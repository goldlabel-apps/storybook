## Animated SVG

[PR](https://github.com/listingslab-software/storybook/pull/2)

Takes an SVG **component** and then changes how it displays according to parameters provided by storybook knobs. The idea is that you can cause a graphic to look different over time. Lets say you have a daashboard and part of the brief for that is to surface the percentage of customer support 100% satisfaction, you want to show the current percentage, the target and display the graphic differently as the percentage increates.

That's the idea, let's see where we go from here.
