## Playing the game

On starting the game, the first egg is laid. it is the focus of the screen. It wiggles for a second and then hatches into the first stage of it's lifecycle, the chick.

The player must name the chick and select it's colour to continue.

Chuckens have a hunger meter, a thirsty meter and a happy meter. When they are happy, if they are a hen, they lay an egg every day.

The aim of the game is to have as many hens laying eggs as you can within the resource parameters set by the game.

Along the way you might be able to add different breeds of chuckens such as **Bobbily Heads**

You interact with each chicken in your flock once a day, although you can interact with the flock as often as you like, it just won't have any effect on the chickens.

The point is to keep you coming back regularly to checkup on your chooks, keep them happy and keep them laying.

There are no in-game ads. It's free and always will be.
