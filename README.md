[Storybook](https://www.learnstorybook.com/) can be used as a Design System to create bulletproof UI components and allow more iteration between UI/UX & Development, perhaps resulting in better software.

Think of storybook as the construct. Like in the Matrix. The construct is a playground we control. We can use any dependencies, we can code as badly or as well as we want too. Even hit stuff with big hammers to see what happens is ok because it's not going to impact anything important.
