Storybook is the construct. Like in the Matrix.

## What is storybook used for? 

Storybook is an excellent piece of JavaScript software which can be used to keep components comlpetely separate from their intended use. This has many benefits. Let's say a company has many apps, they can create a set of UI components which look and function identically across all the companie's apps. This is used brilliantly by people like Atlassian and Airbnb and in a really crap way by thousands of others.

Another approach is to use Storybook is as part of the development process. For us, Stories are the finest grain in our Agile GitHub workflow. Everything starts with a Story.
